Compat header files for RTM and HLE on gcc

RTM and HLE are the two programing interfaces to Intel TSX.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_Synchronization_Extensions

Newer compilers have intrinsics for the HLE and RTM instructions.
These headers files provide them for older gcc (and gcc compatible
like clang, icc, sun cc) compilers.

rtm.h 	
Provides the standard TSX intrinsics _xbegin(), _xend(), _xtest(), _xabort()

hle-official.h	
Same as rtm.h (compat name)

rtm-goto.h 	
Alternative unofficial RTM intrinsics implementation
for gcc 4.6 with asm goto support (Fedora) or gcc 4.7+
This saves a few instruction for every transaction setup
by exposing the jump to the abort handler to the programmer.
Useful for people who care about micro optimizations.

hle-emulation.h
An emulation of the gcc 4.8+ HLE atomic intrinsics
These are similar in spirit, but do not fully match the intrinsics.

hle-ms.h
An emulation of the Microsoft compiler HLE intrinsics for gcc.
